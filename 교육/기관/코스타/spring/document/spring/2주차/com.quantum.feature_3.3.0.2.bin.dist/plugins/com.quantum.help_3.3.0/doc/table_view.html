<h1>The Table View </h1>
<p>The Table View is where the queries against the database show their results. 
  It looks like:</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_table_view.jpg" width="505" height="155"></p>
<p>It's a display-only view. You cannot edit the results. It shows only the first 
  200 records of the resulting row set from you query. This number is configurable, 
  in the preferences. You can navigate to the next group of records using the 
  downward-pointing arrow in the toolbar <img src="images/quantum_table_view_down_arrow.jpg" width="23" height="23">. 
  In this case the arrow is subdued because there are only 4 records in the table. 
  It'll be shown yellow if active, that is if there are more records afterwards. 
  The upward-pointing arrow makes the same work moving upwards in the row set. 
  The third button allows you to see all your rows. Be careful with that if you 
  have tables with many rows, it can take a long time and end up your memory.</p>
<p>The tab name in this case defaults to the name of the database bookmark against 
  which the query was executed. You can see the query as a tooltip pop-up window 
  if you hover the mouse pointer over the tab. If you opened a table or view directly 
  from the bookmark view, then Quantum knows which table and schema is, and it 
  shows it also in the tab.</p>
<p>The &quot;X&quot; sign in the toolbar <img src="images/quantum_table_view_close.jpg" width="24" height="29"> 
  closes the active tab, the two &quot;X&quot;s <img src="images/quantum_table_view_close_all.jpg" width="26" height="24"> 
  button closes all the open tabs. The two circling arrows <img src="images/quantum_table_view_reload.jpg" width="23" height="24"> 
  reload the data from the database. You have to use it after inserting a new 
  record, for example, to see it reflected in the table data. The last button 
  <img src="images/quantum_table_view_filter.jpg" width="22" height="26"> allows 
  filter and sorting. It'll display a dialog that will help you to build a <b>WHERE</b> 
  clause and a <b>ORDER BY</b> clause, and automatically apply it to your row 
  set. The displayed dialog is like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_table_view_filter_dialog.jpg" width="713" height="376"></p>
<p>The generated WHERE and ORDER BY clauses appear in the lower part of the dialog, 
  and you can select the intervening columns, the operators, etc. The working 
  is rather straightforward. You hit the <b> Finish</b> button, and the filter-order 
  gets applied. There is no provision for editing the existing filter. Next time 
  you enter the dialog, it'll be blank.</p>
<p> <b>Filter&amp;Sort</b> works only with tables and/or views, not with custom 
  queries you can write. The reason is that when you double-click on a table or 
  view, the query to display that table is generated by Quantum itself, so it 
  can change the generation to reflect other ordering. When it's a custom query 
  we would need some SQL syntax analysis to know how to change the query. That 
  might be possible in a future, but not now.</p>
<h3><b>The context menu</b></h3>
<p>The data in a database string can be converted into visual characters in many 
  ways. To take into account such variability, the displaying of strings in the 
  Table view allow for changes of encoding. To do that, just right-click on any 
  point of the table view, and a context menu wll appear. If you see correctly 
  your strings, you don't need to concern yourself with encoding changes.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_table_view_context_menu.jpg" width="135" height="188"></p>
<p>The first section of the context menu allows you to select the encoding, listing 
  the three most popular, and then another sub-menu <b>Other Encodings</b> has 
  all the rest of encodings available in your java virtual machine. (Note that 
  this feature &quot;Other Encodings&quot; is only available in java from version 
  1.4 onwards, so it won't work if you are using java 1.3 or older).</p>
<p>The next command is <b>Copy</b>, that will do a simple copy of the selected 
  data, with the columns separated by spaces.</p>
<p>The next is <b>Select All</b>, that needs no introduction.</p>
<p>Then come three Wizards (hey! that could be a nice title for a fantasy book 
  :), that help you create respectively an SQL <b>Insert</b>, <b>Update</b>, or 
  <b>Delete</b>. </p>
<p>If you have the Export-Import (flatfiles) plugin installed, a new option will 
  appear (<b>Esport Result Set Data</b>), that will allow you to export to some 
  formats the resulting data from your query. Only the data that is really shown 
  in the Table data will be exported. </p>
<h4>The Insert Row Wizard.</h4>
<p>The Insert wizards look like:</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_insert_wizard.jpg" ></p>
<p>You fill up the values (in the <b>Value</b> column), and select <b>Def.</b> 
  if you don't want to apply a value, and so the default value of the database 
  for that column will apply. The wizard will automatically quote the appropiate 
  values. If it's wrong, or you need a keyword (like NULL) or a function, you 
  can tell the wizard not to quote that value with the <b>NO Quote</b> column.</p>
<p>Then you hit <b>Finish</b> and the Insert statement will be executed. Remember 
  to hit the <b>Refresh</b> button in the Table View so that the inserted row 
  gets reflected in your displayed data.</p>
<h4>The Update Row Wizard.</h4>
<p>The <b>Update Row Wizard</b> helps you to create an UPDATE statement. Like 
  in the <b>Insert Row Wizard</b>, you have first a column of names of your table 
  columns, that you cannot alter, then another column with the actual values of 
  the columns, that you also cannot alter. If you had a row selected when you 
  enter the wizard, the values of that row will appear in this column. Then you 
  can select if that &quot;old value&quot; will be used as part of the WHERE clause 
  of the UPDATE. If you have a row selected in the Table View, and the row has 
  a primary key, the columns of the primary key will be selected in this Where 
  column.</p>
<p>Then you select the new values. Those default also to the old values, but can 
  be changed. Then you select the &quot;Set value&quot; column to indicate that 
  you really want to update that table column. You can review the generated UPDATE 
  statement in the lower part of the dialog. There will be no UPDATE statement 
  till you select at lease one &quot;Set Value&quot; check-box in the dialog, 
  that is updating at least one column.</p>
<p> The wizard will automatically quote the appropiate values. If it's wrong, 
  or you need a keyword (like NULL) or a function, you can tell the wizard not 
  to quote that value with the <b>NO Quote</b> column. Same with the <b>Key No 
  Quote</b> column, only that applies to values of the Where clause.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_update_wizard.jpg" ></p>
<h4>The Delete Row Wizard.</h4>
<p>Similar to the other two, the Delete Wizard helps you to build a DELETE statement. 
  For a DELETE statement, all you have to select is the WHERE clause. So you select 
  the values that you want, in the &quot;Values&quot; column, and tell the wizard 
  to use them in the WHERE clause by selecting the &quot;Where&quot; check-box. 
</p>
<p>If you have selected a row in the Table View when you enter the Delete wizard, 
  and that table has a primary key, the columns of the primary key will appear 
  already selected, allowing you to easily delete the row you have selected.</p>
<p>The wizard will automatically quote the appropiate values of the key. If it's 
  wrong, you can tell the wizard not to quote that value with the <b>Key No Quote</b> 
  column ,that applies to values of the Where clause.</p>
