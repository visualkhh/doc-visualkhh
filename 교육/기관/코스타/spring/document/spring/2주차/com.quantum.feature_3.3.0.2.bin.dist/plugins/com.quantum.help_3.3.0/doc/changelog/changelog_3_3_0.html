<h1>Changes Since 3.0.4</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The old bookmark format (from Eclipse 2) is no longer supported, so if you 
    install over some very old bookmarks (that you haven't changed at all in four 
    years or so) you may have problems. Just open the bookmarks with the previous 
    release, change something and exit Quantum. The bookmarks will be saved in 
    the new fomat.</li>
