   <description>
      Offers a Beanshell View that allows you to write scripts that
manipulate data from the database. See the
Quantum help for more info. Beanshell is a lightweight
scripting language with a sintax very similar to Java. From the
beanshell website (www.beanshell.org) : &quot;BeanShell dynamically
executes standard Java syntax and extends it with common scripting
conveniences such as loose types, commands, and method closures
like those in Perl and JavaScript.&quot;
