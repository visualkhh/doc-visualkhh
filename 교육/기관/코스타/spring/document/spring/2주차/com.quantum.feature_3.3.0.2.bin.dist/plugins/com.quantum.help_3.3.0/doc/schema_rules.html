<h1>Choosing Which Schemas You Want to View</h1>
<p>Optionally, the fourth page of the Bookmark Wizard lets you choose which 
schemas you want to work with.</p>
 
<img src="images/quantum_new_bookmark/page4.gif" />

<p>By default, bookmarks are set up to view all schemas.

<p>If your database doesn't support schemas (like, for example, MySQL), then the 
  schema selection rule has no effect. The default schema is the same as the user 
  name you have <a href="jdbc_connection_details.html">previouly</a> selected 
  to log in the database.
