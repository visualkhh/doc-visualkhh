<h1>Changes Since 2.4.5</h1>

<ul>
  <li>A pop-up menu now appears in the SQL Query view. This pop-up menu gives 
    you access to some new features. <img src="../images/quantum_query_view_context_menu.jpg"> 
  </li>
  <li>Added an EXPLAIN action in the SQL Query View. The EXPLAIN action tries 
    to perform a database-specific EXPLAIN on the query. Available only to few 
    databases. If you are interested in adding to yours, please explain :) how 
    the EXPLAIN facility works in your database.</li>
  <li>The ability to work with files that end in .sql or .ddl has been restored. 
    The EXECUTE and EXPLAIN actions are also available from the pop-up menu of 
    those editors, as well. 
  <li>The strAdded a DDL Export facility.</li>
  <li>Revised the SQL Log to capture more logging information. This will be most 
    apparent to users in two ways: 
    <ol>
      <li>The colors have changed.</li>
      <li>The log will capture information even before the Log view has been made 
        visible.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Added a new option to the bookmark preferences, <b>Ignore the Autocommit 
    setting of the Query View</b>,that does just that. If set, the connection 
    for that bookmark will have the AutoCommit defined in the first option, no 
    matter what the Query View says. Note that this behaviour will be silent, 
    so you have to be sure of what you are doing when setting this option, specially 
    if you have the &quot;on-connection AutoCommit&quot; option to <b>Always True</b>. 
  <li>Added a new view, Beanshell script View. This view adds scripting capabilities 
    to the Quantum plugin. It's basically a quick wrapup of the Beanshell facility. 
    I cite from <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/">its website</a>: 
    <p><i>BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable Java source interpreter with 
      object scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell dynamically 
      executes standard Java syntax and extends it with common scripting conveniences 
      such as loose types, commands, and method closures like those in Perl and 
      JavaScript.</i></p>
    <p> For more information, refer to the Quantum Help, installed as a extension 
      of the Eclipse Help, under Getting Started-&gt;Beanshell Script View. 
  <li>The Insert, Update and Delete Wizards have been added a column that disables 
    quoting. 
  <li> In the context menu for items of the Bookmark View, some changes have been 
    made, some regrouping, and a new group called Structure. 
    <blockquote> 
      <p> The <b>Structure </b>submenu groups all actions having to do with the 
        metadata of the selected table(s) or view(s). </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>Copy</b> will make a full structure copy of the selected items. 
          The resulting XML may differ, usually being more extensive than the 
          normal Copy action of the table.</p>
        <p><b>Write to file...</b> saves the full structure XML to a file that 
          the user selects.</p>
        <p><b>DDL from clipboard</b> is a VERY experimental feature that tries 
          to create a DDL statement that would create a table, view or sequence 
          similar in structure to the ones selected. The structure data is taken 
          from the clipboard. Note that even if this option appears when you select 
          a table, you must be on a Bookmark or Schema to generate DDL for a table. 
          The development of this feature is in very early stages, basically working 
          only partially for ORACLE at the moment, but we make it available in 
          case somebody has a use for it. The generated DDL will be pasted into 
          the Query View, <font color="#FF0000">deleting whatever is there.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font color="#000000">The XML definition for most of the structure is in 
    state of flow, so it could change in the future, you shouldn't write utilities 
    that use that XML definition. If you want you database to be supported sooner 
    rather than later, you can write with explanations of the proper DDL sentences 
    to apply for generation. If some data is missing in the XML definition, say 
    it.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#000000">We are trying to improve the tab management in the 
    Table View. Now you won't get a new tab if your selected table, view or query 
    is already opened. More changes are on the way, and you could share your ideas 
    about what would you like on that respect. For example, you like the different 
    tabs, or could you do with a single tab showing only the last requested data. 
    What do you prefer ? </font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">At the request of a user, we have added a <b>Copy 
    As Java.</b></font> The <b>Copy As Java</b> option will copy the existing 
    text in the Query View and format it ready to be inserted as java code for 
    the creation of a String. For example: 
    <p><code>SELECT * <br>
      FROM &quot;TEMP&quot;<br>
      WHERE ID = 45</code></p>
    <p>will be copied to the clipboard as :</p>
    <p><code>&quot;SELECT * &quot; +<br>
      &quot;FROM \&quot;TEMP\&quot; &quot; +<br>
      &quot;WHERE ID = 45 &quot; ;</code></p>
    <font color="#000000"><b> </b></font></li>
</ul>
