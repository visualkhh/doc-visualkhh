<h1>Changes Since 3.0.2</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The bookmark view has been changed to allow search of references between 
    database objects. The support is experimental and is definitely not guaranteed 
    to find all references, and practically guaranteed to sometimes found more 
    references than really exist. That's because the search is done text-based 
    and so espureous references may pop up.</li>
  <li>Ms Access support has improved. See the Quantum help for more details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for developers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>More documentation for developers is available in the Quantum help. A document 
    called the Quantum cookbook can point you to the parts of the code you want.</li>
</ul>
