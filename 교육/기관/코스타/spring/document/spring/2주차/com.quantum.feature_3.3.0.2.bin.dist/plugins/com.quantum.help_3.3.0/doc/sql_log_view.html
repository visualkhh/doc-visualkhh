<h1>The SQL Log View</h1>
<p>This view logs most of the SQL queries that are sent to the database, and also 
  some action, like connection to a bookmark. To activate it you have to show 
  it in the workspace. It's not enough that it's present, Eclipse only creates 
  a view when really needed, so you need to display it. From that moment on, you 
  have a log of the SQL queries you make, and also of most of the implicit queries 
  that Quantum makes to extract data from the database.</p>

<p>There is an icon in the toolbar of the view, with an eraser,<img src="images/quantum_sql_log_view_eraser.jpg" width="36" height="25"> 
  that clears the log.</p>
<p>You can set some preferences in the <a href="preferences_properties.html">Quantum 
  preferences</a> window.</p>
