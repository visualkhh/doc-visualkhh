<h1>Setting up Eclipse to develop Quantum</h1>
<p>To follow this guide you need the Eclipse version 3 or higher.</p>
<p>First you go to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open a Perspective</span> 
  and open the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CVS repository exploring perspective</span>. 
  It can be in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Others...</span>. You get 
  a perspective. You right-click on the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">CVS Repositories</span> view and create a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">New -&gt; Repository Location...</span><br>
  The data to access quantum is:<br>
  <br>
  Host: <b>quantum.cvs.sourceforge.net</b><br>
  Repository Path: <span style="font-weight: bold;">/cvsroot/quantum</span><br>
  User: <span style="font-weight: bold;">anonymous</span><br>
  Password:<br>
  <br>
  There is no password for <span style="font-style: italic;">anonymous</span>. 
  You can substitute the User and Password for you own, if you are registered 
  in <a href="http://sourceforge.net">sourcefoge.net</a>. If you want developer 
  access, remember to use <span
 style="font-style: italic;">extssh</span> as the connexion type, so as to be 
  able to update the cvs repository with your changes (that need a ssh connection 
  in <a href="http://sourceforge.net">sourceforge</a>). Of course to modify you 
  also need to be in the list of Quantum developers in sourceforge.<br>
  <br>
  After that, if you are connected to the Net, you will be able to get the project 
  files. You will see a <span style="font-weight: bold;">HEAD</span> sub-item, 
  a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Branches</span>, and a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Versions</span>. You select the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">HEAD</span>, and then right-click onto <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">quantum-plugin</span>. Then select <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Check Out</span>. After downloading from CVS all the 
  files of the Quantum project, Eclipse will create a new project in your workspace 
  called <b>quantum-plugin</b>. The other plugins that are active are <b>com.quantum.dbunit</b>, 
  and <b>com.quantum.flatfiles</b>. They are mostly concerned with exporting of 
  data and metadata. If you want to add to the Quantum help, you need the <b>com.quantum.help</b> 
  plugin.</p>
<p>After checking out the projects, you can go to the Plug-in Development perspective 
  to see the projects.</p>
<p>If you don't have the GEF plugin installed, you'll get a lot of errors. Download 
  and install the GEF plugin from the Eclipse web site. After that, you should 
  be free of errors.</p>
<p>Mylar is an Eclipse plugin that helps you with tasks. If you want to intall 
  Mylar and connect it to the bugs and feature requests lists on the Quantum sourceforge 
  project, do as follows:</p>
<p>Install Mylar. Search for instructions on installing Mylar on the Mylar-Eclipse 
  website.</p>
<p>Then show the View <b>Task Repositories</b>, where you'll add a new repository 
  for connecting with the sourceforge web site. In the <b>Server</b> box, select 
  the &quot;Azureus (SourceForge)&quot; option. That's a <i>template</i>. It'll 
  connect you to the sourceforge site, but using the azureus project data. As 
  that's not what you want, you change the <b>Label</b> box to be something more 
  Quantum related, then introduce your username and password in sourceforge.net 
  and hit Finish. I'm not sure if you need to modify the parameters there, as 
  you'll provide them later in the Query, but I did it, so you can too. The <b>group_id</b> 
  of Quantum is 7746 and the <b>atid</b> is 107746 (for the bug tracker).</p>
<p>Now go to the <b>Task List</b> view and choose <b>New -&gt; Query</b>. Select 
  the just created sourceforge repository and hit <b>Next</b>. Then introduce 
  the needed parameters, the <b>group_id</b> of Quantum is 7746 and the <b>atid</b> 
  is 107746 (for the bug tracker), and 357746 (for the features request tracker). 
  Now you should see the tasks. If you want to know how to work with tasks in 
  Mylar, go to the Mylar website and see a webinar or read a tutorial or something 
  like that.</p>
