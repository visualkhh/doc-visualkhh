<h1>The Beanshell Script View</h1>
<p>This view adds scripting capabilities to the Quantum plugin. It's basically 
  a quick wrapup of the Beanshell facility. I cite from <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/">its 
  website</a>:</p>
<p><i>BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable Java source interpreter with object 
  scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell dynamically executes 
  standard Java syntax and extends it with common scripting conveniences such 
  as loose types, commands, and method closures like those in Perl and JavaScript.</i></p>
<p>For a complete information on Beanshell, syntax and capabilities, please go 
  to its website (http://www.beanshell.org).</p>
<p>The view is opened in Quantum just like any other view, in <b>Window-&gt;Show 
  View-&gt;Other... Quantum DB-&gt;Beanshell View</b>. This view, from Quantum 
  3.3 onwards, is an <i>optional</i> plugin, so if you don't see that view appear 
  in the list, it might be that you haven't installed it.</p>
<p>Then something like this should appear:</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_beanshell_view.jpg" width="486" height="130"></p>
<p>Of course with no text at first. Then you can write the script, </p>
<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++) {
	print(&quot;test(&quot; + i + &quot;)&quot;);
</code><code>}</code></pre>
<p>and hit the green arrow (execute). That should generate :</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_beanshell_view_result.jpg" width="483" height="198"></p>
<p>As you see, the results will be highlighted with a grey background. </p>
<p>That's not very interesting, of course. But it gets more interesting as you 
  can access the Quatum data, and manipulate it, as shown in the next example. 
  If you write:</p>
<pre><code>import com.quantum.ExternalInterface;

String[][] data = ExternalInterface.getDataFromResultSet(0);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; data.length; i++) {
	print(&quot;newObject = newDate(\&quot;&quot; + data[i][4] + &quot;\&quot;);&quot;);
	print(&quot;arrayObject.add(newObject);&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="images/quantum_beanshell_view_data_example.jpg" width="378" height="614"></p>
<p>As you can see, we have to import the Quantum <b><a href="ExternalInterface.html">ExternalInterface</a></b> 
  class (or fully qualify it when used). This class is used to give easy access 
  to data from Quantum to external code. Its functions are to be rather stable, 
  or at least we'll try to keep them that way :)</p>
<p>As can be seen in the image, we use the <code>getDataFromResultSet()</code> 
  function, that returms an array of data from a recordset opened in the Table 
  View. Then we use the data to generate some &quot;code&quot; that can then be 
  pasted or saved. For the shell to work, the fifth column data[4] of the first 
  opened table in the Table View (getDataFromResultSet(0)) has to be a date value.</p>
<p>As I said previously, this is a quick wrapup of the Beanshell library, so the 
  facilities are minimal. Nothing is customizable (not even the font), there is 
  no syntax highlighting, or undo, or find/replace (just like in the Query View, 
  you'll feel right at home :). All your written code will be executed as a unit 
  (however, the interpreter will remember the state from one execution to another, 
  so if you set a variable, it'll remain set till you close the view). The view 
  will differentiate between code written and generated output, so you can save 
  both independent. Hitting the <b>Clear</b> button (the one with the eraser) 
  will clear only the output. If you want to clear it all, there is an option 
  in the toolbar menu. That menu runs as : </p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_beanshell_view_menu.jpg" width="158" height="131"></p>
<p>The options are self-explanatory. You can export an script. That option will 
  export only the unmarked lines (the lines with no grey background). You can 
  later import that script. You can export the output, that is the lines with 
  grey background. And you can clear the whole window.</p>
<p>That's more or less all. Using the ExternalInterface and the Beanshell will 
  take some trials, but the Beanshell syntax is more or less java, and probably 
  you won't need that many methods of the ExternalInterface.</p>
