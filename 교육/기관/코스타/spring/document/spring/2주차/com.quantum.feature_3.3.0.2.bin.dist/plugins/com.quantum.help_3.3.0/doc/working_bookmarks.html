<h1>Working with bookmarks.</h1>
<p>After creating the bookmark, it appears in the bookmark view.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_new_bookmark.jpg" width="188" height="44"></p>
<p>Then you'll probably want to open it. Double-click on the bookmark and it'll 
  try to connect. If everything is all right, the sign will change to </p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_open_bookmark.jpg" width="206" height="46"></p>
<p>(In this case, I have in my bookmark view, selected the <code>Show Database 
  Info</code> toggle switch in the <a href="#toolbarMenu">toolbar menu</a>. That 
  shows the info between square brackets. )</p>
<p>Note: You can have as many bookmarks as you want opened at the same time.</p>
<p>You can then expand the tree, clicking on the &quot;+&quot; sign. You'll be 
  able to get something like</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_expanded_bookmark.jpg" width="299" height="269"></p>
<p>The most inmediate part is the tables and views structure, that shows the defined 
  tables, views, and so on for the schemas that we wanted. In the image, only 
  one schema (<code>public</code>) is shown. You can expand the a table or view 
  to see the columns. The little key sign left of the column icon <img src="images/quantum_key_column_icon.jpg" width="23" height="23"> 
  means that the column is a primary key column for that table. Double-clicking 
  on a table or view opens that table or view in the <a href="table_view.html">Table 
  View</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Uses_usedby"></a>Uses/Used by</h2>
<p>From release 3.0.4, the tables and views have a couple of new tags that give 
  info about the relationships between them. This tags are the <b>Uses/Used by</b> 
  couple.</p>
<p><img src="images/uses_usedby.jpg" width="297" height="223"></p>
<p>Basically these two tags give info about what tables-views a view selects from 
  and, more importantly, which views select from my table-view. That way, if you 
  make a change to a table, you can know which views it's affecting. Opening the 
  <b>Views</b> node in the &quot;Used by&quot; will scan all views in the schema, 
  so it'll be a long operation, be warned. The functionality is very beta, and 
  you cannot trust the results, even if they are tweaked into giving more false 
  positives than negatives. The user interface is also subject to change, suggestions 
  are welcome.</p>
<h2><a name="quickList"></a>The Quick List</h2>
<p>The Quick List is simply a quick reference for your most used tables and views. 
  If you use frequently a table, you don't want to have to look it up, amongst 
  perhaps tens of others, every time that you need it. To add a table or view 
  to the Quick List, just right-click on the table or view, and select <code>Add 
  to Quick List</code> from the Context Menu. </p>
<h2><a name="recentQueries"></a>The Recent SQL Statements</h2>
<p>The <code>Recent SQL Statements</code> folders saves the last SQL statements 
  that you have issued in the <code><a href="query_editor_view.html">SQL Query 
  Editor</a></code> view. You can double-click on a query, and that cleans the 
  SQL Editor, and inserts your selected query in it. Also, the bookmark that you 
  used gets selected as the current bookmark to execute against, so the next time 
  you execute anything in the SQL Editor, that bookmark will be used.</p>
<p>Note that only the queries you yourself execute in the SQL Editor will be stored 
  as Recent SQL Statements, not implicit queries that Quantum may make to get 
  data from tables or structure data. If you want to know all the queries that 
  get sent to your database, you can activate the<a href="sql_log_view.html"> 
  SQL Log View</a>. After activating (opening) the SQL Log View, all messages 
  sent to the database will be logged there for you to check. Also errors from 
  the database will be logged. To open the View, proceed like to open any Eclipse 
  view, that is go to <code>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Others... &gt; QuantumDB &gt; 
  Quantum SQL Log</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="contextMenu"></a>The Context Menu</h2>
<p>If you right-click on the different items, you'll get a context menu with different 
  options depending on the type of item you selected. Right-clicking on a table, 
  for example, gives the following context menu:</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_table_context_menu.jpg" ></p>
<p>The <b>New Bookmark </b>is already known, allows you to create another bookmark.</p>
<p><b>Copy </b>allows to copy the structure of the table, in XML format, to the 
  clipboard. An example of the format :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;<br>
    &lt;metadata&gt;<br>
    &lt;table database=&quot;Postgres&quot; isSynonym=&quot;false&quot; name=&quot;films&quot; 
    schema=&quot;public&quot;&gt;<br>
    &lt;column java.sql.Types=&quot;1&quot; name=&quot;code&quot; nullable=&quot;false&quot; 
    position=&quot;1&quot; primaryKey=&quot;true&quot; size=&quot;5&quot; type=&quot;bpchar&quot; 
    /&gt;<br>
    &lt;column java.sql.Types=&quot;12&quot; name=&quot;title&quot; nullable=&quot;false&quot; 
    position=&quot;2&quot; primaryKey=&quot;false&quot; size=&quot;40&quot; type=&quot;varchar&quot; 
    /&gt;<br>
    &lt;column java.sql.Types=&quot;2&quot; name=&quot;did&quot; nullable=&quot;false&quot; 
    position=&quot;3&quot; primaryKey=&quot;false&quot; size=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;numeric&quot; 
    /&gt;<br>
    &lt;column java.sql.Types=&quot;91&quot; name=&quot;date_prod&quot; nullable=&quot;true&quot; 
    position=&quot;4&quot; primaryKey=&quot;false&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; type=&quot;date&quot; 
    /&gt;<br>
    &lt;column java.sql.Types=&quot;1&quot; name=&quot;kind&quot; nullable=&quot;true&quot; 
    position=&quot;5&quot; primaryKey=&quot;false&quot; size=&quot;10&quot; type=&quot;bpchar&quot; 
    /&gt;<br>
    &lt;column java.sql.Types=&quot;1111&quot; name=&quot;len&quot; nullable=&quot;true&quot; 
    position=&quot;6&quot; primaryKey=&quot;false&quot; size=&quot;12&quot; type=&quot;interval&quot; 
    /&gt;<br>
    &lt;/table&gt;<br>
    &lt;/metadata&gt;</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The format is still in flow, as new items are added to it. No formal description 
  of it is to be had, till some semblance of stability is adquired. So if you 
  plan to invest time in some program that uses this format as input, please check 
  first the status of the format with the developers.</p>
<p><b>Export</b> and <b>Import </b>are the standard eclipse functions. Quantum 
  extends Eclipse with a couple of export possibilities. To learn more about it, 
  see <a href="export_import.html">Export and Import</a>.</p>
<p><b>View Table</b> is the default action, taken also when you double-click on 
  the table. It opens the table on the Table View.</p>
<p><b>View Table Details</b> will open in the Table View a fake table (fake in 
  the sense that it's not a proper table of any database) with the metadata of 
  the table you have selected. This metadata is got from the database in a different 
  way as the others, so the infos it can display are also different.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_view_table_details.jpg" width="407" height="108"></p>
<p><b>Add to Quick List</b> adds the table to the quick list of its bookmark. 
  In the menu image is not active because the selected table is already in the 
  Quick List. For the same reason is <b>Remove from Quick List</b> active. That 
  option removes the table from the Quick List. This action of course affects 
  not the underlying database table.</p>
<p>The <b>SQL Statements</b> is a submenu for options that generate and execute 
  an SQL Statement refering to the selected table. It has two options to date: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b> Drop Table/View/Sequence</b> that allows you to generate a simple DROP 
    statement with the selected item (table, view or sequence). This of course 
    would delete the underlying table, view or sequence from the database, so 
    use with care. Even if the <b>Auto-Commit</b> option is not active, some databases 
    make the changes to data dictionary to be always auto commited, so test your 
    setup before using that command.</p>
  <p><b>Delete All Rows</b> does just that, generating a DELETE statement that 
    will delete all table rows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <b>Structure </b>submenu groups all actions having to do with the metadata 
  of the selected table(s) or view(s).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Copy</b> will make a full structure copy of the selected items. The resulting 
    XML may differ, usually being more extensive than the normal Copy action of 
    the table.</p>
  <p><b>Write to file...</b> saves the full structure XML to a file that the user 
    selects.</p>
  <p><b>DDL from clipboard</b> is a VERY experimental feature that tries to create 
    a DDL statement that would create a table, view or sequence similar in structure 
    to the ones selected. The structure data is taken from the clipboard. Note 
    that even if this option appears when you select a table, you must be on a 
    Bookmark or Schema to generate DDL for a table. The development of this feature 
    is in very early stages, basically working only partially for ORACLE at the 
    moment, but we make it available in case somebody has a use for it. The generated 
    DDL will be pasted into the Query View, <font color="#FF0000">deleting whatever 
    is there.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Search</b> opens up the Eclipse Search dialog with the Database search page. You can search for text, regular expressions, numbers and dates. More info in <a href="search.html">this 
  link</a>. </p>
<p><b>Refresh</b> applies to the whole opened tables or views folder, not only 
  to the selected table or view. It refreshes the list of tables/views to reflect 
  changes in the database. For example, if you drop a table using the previous 
  command, the change will not be reflected into the bookmarks tree structrure 
  till you refresh it.</p>
<p><b>Properties</b> opens up a Properties dialog where you can check and sometimes 
  change different data from the bookmarks, tables, views, etc. More info in <a href="preferences_properties.html">this 
  link</a>. </p>
<h2>The toolbar</h2>
<p>In the toolbar there are a couple of buttons and a toolbar menu. The first 
  button is a <b>Create New Bookmark</b> button <img src="images/quantum_new_bookmark_button.jpg" width="31" height="24"> 
  and works same as selecting the <b>New Bookmark</b> context menu item.</p>
<p>The second button <img src="images/quantum_collapse_all_button.jpg" width="24" height="29"> 
  allows you to collapse all your opened trees in the bookmark view, to reduce 
  clutter.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><a name="toolbarMenu"></a>The Toolbar Menu</h3>
<p>If you open the toolbar menu in the <img src="images/quantum_bookmark_toolbar_menu_arrow.jpg" width="15" height="17"> 
  sign on the toolbar, the following menu will pop up. </p>
<h2><img src="images/quantum_bookmark_toolbar_menu.jpg" width="189" height="122"></h2>
<p>The <b>Show Tabe Sizes</b> menu selection will show the table size, in number 
  or records, at every table name you have in the bookmark view. That can be pretty 
  expensive in terms of time and resources, as a query needs to be done for every 
  table in view.</p>
<p>The <b>Show Database Info</b> will show the type of the database and version 
  at every open bookmark in the bookmark view.</p>
<p><b>Export Bookmarks</b> creates an export file with info about the bookmarks 
  you select. That allows you to re-create some previous bookmark structure after 
  making changes to it, or copying the same bookmarks between machines.In the 
  latter case, please note that the bookmarks have the driver path info, so that 
  path might have to be changed if the driver is not at the same place in the 
  different machines.</p>
<p><b>Import Bookmarks</b> allows to import one such file. The import won't change 
  or substitute any existing bookmark, so delete all bookmarks previously if you 
  want a full substitution.</p>
<h2>Using Working Sets</h2>
<p>As from 3.0.4, you can use working sets to filter the bookmarks. For the moment, 
  just the bookmark list, not the database objects inside. To do that, just open 
  your working set manager dialog using the toolbar button<img src="images/working_set_button.jpg" width="39" height="28">, 
  and then selecting a new working set in the dialog that will appear. Then you 
  should get something like:</p>
<p><img src="images/working_set_dialog.jpg" width="373" height="343"></p>
<p>With the Quantum Database Bookmarks type on it. If it doesn't appear, something 
  isn't working, or you have Quantum release previous to 3.0.4. You select the 
  Quantum Database Bookmarks type and then you can select which bookmarks to show 
  when the working set is selected. You can define several working sets and select 
  one or more at each time. If you have none selected, or the selected ones have 
  no bookmark selected inside, all bookmarks will be shown. This allow you to 
  filter your bookmarks depending on your work context. If you are used to working 
  sets, know that the Bookmark View will use only the Window Working Set, and 
  cannot select a different one.</p>
