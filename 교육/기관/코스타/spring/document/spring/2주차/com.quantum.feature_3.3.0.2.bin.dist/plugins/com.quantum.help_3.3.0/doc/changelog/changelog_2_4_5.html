<h1>Changes Since 2.4.4</h1>

<ul>
  <li> The Other Encodings Action on the ResultSet view (a.k.a. the table view) 
    depended on classes only available in JDK 1.4. The action is excluded under 
    JDK 1.3. </li>
  <li> A Collapse All action has been added to the Bookmark View.

  </li>
  <li>The JDBC Driver dialog of the New Bookmark wizard now allows deleting drivers.

  </li>
  <li>Some bug fixes about the display of BLOBS and very big columns in general.</li>
  <li>Feature request 1100049 is implemented. It makes Quantum change the default 
    execution bookmark in the SQL Query View when a query is pasted there from 
    the Recent SQL Statements list.</li>
  <li>To the Properties of the Views, a new page has been added &quot;SQL&quot; 
    with the SELECT clause used to create the view (mind that it may not be exact, 
    as clauses like WITH CHECK OPTION can be not included, check the SQL92 standard, 
    and in any case, it'll depend on database, as IBM databases tend to include 
    the CREATE clause, for example). Some databases are not implemented yet, so 
    if you see a blank SQL, contact the Quantum developers with info about the 
    right query for your database.

  </li>
  <li>Some changes to the quoting of table names. Tables with spaces in the name 
    would not be quoted. Now you'll find much more quoting. If you note some problems 
    now with the new system, let us know.</li>
  <li>The Insert Wizard got a new column to select if you don't want to insert 
    the column, and let it with its default value. If you select the column, it 
    won't appear in the columns of the insert.<img src="images/quantum_insert_dialog_default.jpg" width="101" height="59"></li>
  <li>Suggested by Cesar Miquel, added a new property for bookmarks, under the 
    Options tab. It permits you to quote all schemas, tables and columns in the 
    quantum generated SQL. The default is unchecked, that is, quote only the names 
    that have spaces, signs, mixed case or are a reserved keyword (this last only 
    from version 2.4.5).

<li>  A bug relating to DB2 on a z/OS mainframe and the IBM DRDA Driver has
      been resolved.</li>

<li>  At some point, it looks like some code was propagated that allows
      "quoting" of table names.  Some databases, like Oracle, support
      mixed-case table names, and the only way to explicitly refer to
      the mixed case table name is to put quotation marks around it.  Recently,
      it seems that the standard "double-click" on a table in a MySQL database
      started invoking this quoting code, but MySQL doesn't appear to support
      quoted table names.  I've explicitly turned this off for MySQL, but there
      may be some other databases for which this is a problem.</li>

<li>  An export facility has been added to the Result Set View (a.k.a. the
      Table View).  At the moment, only Excel is supported, but soon other
      export formats will be added.</li>

  <li>Deleted the &quot;Subset&quot; view, as it was broken and nobody complained 
    so logically nobody used it. I may re-implement it sometime.</li>
</ul>
