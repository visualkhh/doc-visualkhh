<h1>The Entity-Relationship Editor</h1>
<p>This editor is the Quantum plugin feature for editing entity relationship diagrams. 
It is configured to handle files with .erd extensions. Depending on what you do with it, the editor produces a .sql script that you can execute and enhance with the <a href="sql_editor.html">SQL Editor</a> or a .ddl script that you can execute to alter tables and relations and create them too.
The editor is based on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/">GEF</a> and has drawn heavily from the example provided by <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-GEF-editor/gef-schema-editor.html">Phil Zoio</a>.
The editor has the following features:
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop from <a href="working_bookmarks.html">Bookmark</a> view</li>
<li>Point and click from Palette</li>
<li>Automatic creation of relationships from bookmark view</li>
<li>Scripting of:
<ul>
<li>SQL: Query definition</li>
<li>DDL: Data definition</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Direct editing</li>
<li>Undo/Redo</li>
<li>Zooming</li>
<li>Property support</li>
</ul>
<h2>Invoking the editor</h2>
<p>Create a resource within eclipse with an .erd extension. This should bring up the editor. It will also add actions to the ActionBar:</p>
<img src="images/ActionBarContribution.JPG" alt="Some buttons added to the action bar">
<p>From left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undo/Redo</li>
<li>Toggle automatic layout (under development)</li>
<li>Toggle relationship names</li>
<li>Zoom in/Zoom out</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drag and drop from Bookmark</h2>
<p>This is one of the most powerful features of the editor. After you have created the new file, you can drop tables on the editor and/or drop columns inside already present tables.</p>
<p>Connect to the desired bookmark, navigate to the table of choice, drag it, drop it on the editor:</p>
<img src="images/SimpleDragNDrop.JPG" alt="">
<p>The image shows that you drag from the bookmark to the upper left corner of the resulting 
table. The colors are taken from the <a href="preferences_properties.html">Preference 
Store</a>. If the same table is dragged on the editor more than once an alias will be 
defined for it (views2 in this case). This way you can create queries containing more than
one reference to the same table.</p>
<p>You can also drag a column from one table into another. This can be done from the Bookmark
or from an existing table in the editor. Note that this will create DDL statements, while 
most of the other drag and drop operations will create SQL statements.</p>
<img src="images/DragAColumn.JPG" alt="">
<p>If you drag a column from one table to another, this is what it looks like:</p>
<img src="images/DragAColumnFrom1TableToAnother.JPG" alt="">
<p>First you drop a new table on the editor, then you drag one of that table's columns on another table. Alternatively, you could drag the
column directly from the Bookmark to the target table. The difference is that this will not alter the source table.</p>
<p>Using drag and drop you should be able to quickly transform one database definition into another. Quantum will
use the target database adapter to create the DDL. If the types do not match between the databases... (under development).</p>
<p>The fact that Quantum uses the database adapter for 'DDL rendering' also means that support for these features depend upon the 'completeness'
of that adapter.</p>

<h2>Point and click from palette</h2>
<p>When working with the palette, drag and drop do work, but point and click work better. If you connect to a bookmark with an ERD editor open,
the editor will display the database types in groups in its palette. If you have more than one bookmark open, ... (under development). 
The groups are relatively simple: Numbers, Text and Various:</p>
<img src="images/DataTypesExample.JPG" alt="">
<p>This is an example from mySQL. It shows three different ways to display the palette. Right click on the palette
and use the layout option to select the display of choice. The Entity palette entry is always present. This allows
the addition of tables and columns, without a connected bookmark.</p>
<p>From the palette you can also create relations between tables. For this the relation is used:</p>
<img src="images/Connection.JPG" alt="">
<p>Again, you point it to the dependant/foreign/related table and then click it in the source/primary table. The 
order is important here, because Quantum will automatically assign a primary key constraint
to the destination table and a foreign key to the source.</p>
<p>Before the connection is made:</p>
<img src="images/RelationshipsFromAndToBefore.JPG" alt="">
<p>And after the final click:</p>
<img src="images/RelationshipsFromAndTo.JPG" alt="">
<p>In fact, this is not the way it looks after the final click, you first get a chance to select
the fields participating in the relation and you must enter a name for this relation:</p>
<img src="images/Relationships.JPG" alt="">
<p>You can use the multiple selection features of the column list boxes to create a primary key that
spans more than one column. (Under review). You can also bring up this dialog by double clicking a relation.</p>
<h2>Automatic creation of relationships from bookmark view</h2>
<p>If your database supports foreign key relations, this is honoured by Quantum. Whenever you
drop a table on the editor, Quantum will check if there are relations defined between the tables
already present and the new one. It will even display a foreign key symbol in front of a column when
the related primary table is not part of the diagram.</p>
<p>In real production queries you would rename the aliases. This can be done with direct edit. Just click 
somewhere in the vicinity of the alias name and the direct edit box will become visible. You can enter any
name providing it does not contain spaces (and is not the same as the table name).</p>
<h2>Selecting which columns to target</h2>
<p>Real queries do not produce COUNT(*) results most of the time, but will use selected columns. The editor
supports this through a context sensitive menu. If you right click a column, you can select: Toggle query output. 
That column will become part of the target list. You can also select more than one column, and use the 
command to add the group. Selected columns will have a different background color in their icon:</p>
<h2>Scripts</h2>
<p>As can be seen from the previous chapter, the ultimate result of the editor is not only a diagram, but
also two kind of scripts: Data Defintion Language and Data Manipulation Language (implemented as SQL-92). The latter
script is always produced, the former only when the user has requested it, or the editor has recognized one
of the actions in the editor as a data definition action (new table, new column, column deletion).</p>
<h3>Data Manipulation Scripts</h3>
<p>This kind of script is created when the user saves the diagram. These scripts can be checked for syntactical
correctness using the language features of the <a href="sql_editor.html">SQL Editor</a>. You can influence which
columns are selected, with the use of the context sensitive popup menu (Toggle query output). The editor starts 
with a count(*) target list, which will greatly improve performance if your query somehow misses a vital condition.</p>
<p>You can add extra relations to the diagram (those that were not present in the original database).</p>
<p>A where clause is not supported at the moment, allthough there are plans for this. So, you will need to edit
the generated script.</p>
<h3>Data Definition Scripts</h3>
<p>Here Quantum relies on the database adapters available for Quantum. The call to create a table is forwarded to the
buildCreateTable() function that an adapter may or may not support. There is a default version, but that may produce a
script that you cannot execute against your database. The buildCreateTable() function also calls the following functions
for which no default implementations exist:</p>
<table summary="">
<tr><th>Function name</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Supported by ERD editor</th></tr>
<tr><td>buildPrimaryKey</td><td>ALTER the table created just before and define the primary key(s)</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>buildForeignKeys</td><td>ALTER table statement to define relations between tables</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>buildRemarks</td><td>ALTER table statement to define remarks on columns</td><td>Not at the moment</td></tr>
<tr><td>buildTriggers</td><td>ALTER table statement to define the trigger on a table</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>buildChecks</td><td>ALTER table statement to define checks on columns</td><td>Not at the moment</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Other statements are created from the editor directly:</p>
<table summary="">
<tr><th>Function</th><th>Statement</th></tr>
<tr><td>Add column</td><td>ALTER TABLE tablename ADD columnname type;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Remove column</td><td>ALTER TABLE tablename DROP COLUMN columnName;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rename column</td><td>ALTER TABLE tablename ADD COLUMN columnName;<br>
UPDATE tablename SET columnName = oldColumnName;<br>
ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN oldColumnName;</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This might need to be taken into the Database Adapter.</p>
<h2>Direct editing</h2>
<p>The editor allows for in-place editing of the table name, alias name, column name, type and size.</p>
<p>When you edit a column, you can change the name, the type and the size. Because Quantum
supports all databases, no checks are made on the name and type (other than that they must be
separated by a :). Also no validators are in place on the size at the moment.</p>
<p>Click somewhere in the column's rectangle, and the direct editor will be invoked.</p>
<p>If you are creating new tables and columns, it is simpler to use the palette. Remember to
point and click. The editor will supply the type selected in the column definition.</p>
<img src="images/DirectEditNewColumn.JPG" alt="">
<h2>Context Menu</h2>
<p>The context menu is shown when you click the right mouse button (or the context invoking
key) when hovering over a table or column. This is what it looks like:</p>
<img src="images/ERDEditorContextMenu.JPG" alt="">
<p>Undo/Redo and Zoom In/Zoom Out are the same as those contributed to the Action bar.</p>
<p>Delete will remove a column, a table or a selected group.</p>
<p>The middle portion will depend on your specific eclipse installation.</p>
<p>The bottom item allows you to select whether the specified column(s) are used for output.</p>
<h2>Property support</h2>
<p>If you open the Property view and select a table or a relation in the editor, several
properties are listed. These properties can be changed, and the changes will be reflected
within the diagram. Changes made in the Property view can be undone and redone, just as 
if the changes were made from inside the diagram.</p>
