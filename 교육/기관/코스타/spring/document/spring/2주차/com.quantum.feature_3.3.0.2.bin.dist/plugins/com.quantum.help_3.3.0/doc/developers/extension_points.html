<h1>QuantumDB Extension Points </h1>
<p></p>
<p>Extension points are the standard way of extending plugins in Eclipse. There 
  are three extension points defined in Quantum.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>com.quantum.Quantum.metadata<br>
    com.quantum.Quantum.data<br>
    com.quantum.Quantum.embedded </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first one extends the Bookmark View context menu, allowing other plug-ins 
  to get info on the metadata of the selected tables and/or views, and use it. 
</p>
<p>The second one extends the Table View context menu, allowing other plug-ins 
  to get info on the data of the selected rows, and use it.</p>
<p>The third one allows other plugins to define a database connection, so that 
  Quantum can make a connection to that database. The database can be also provided 
  in the same plugin, or not. The standard Quantum distribution <b>com.quantum.derby</b> 
  plugin extends the <b>com.quantum.Quantum.embedded</b> extension point, allowing 
  Quantum to automatically generate a connection (bookmark) to a Derby database 
  that the plugin also defines.<br>
</p>
<p>In the two first cases, data is passed as an XML document, with an internal 
  definition. This definition could change in the future, so if anybody is developing 
  something using these extension points, let us know so we change with care. 
  In any case, the two first extension points are redundant, and kept only for 
  compatibility purposes, as the same results can be obtained by using standard 
  extension points of the Eclipse menus, and directly calling Quantum methods 
  for getting the info.<br>
</p>
<p>There is an example extender plugin to illustrate the use of these extension 
  points. What the extender plugin does is simply getting the info as an XML document, 
  convert it to text and copy it to the clipboard, but of course other plugins 
  would do more interesting things. This extender plugin can be found on the doc 
  directory of the Quantum plugin, with the name extender.zip. To test it, simply 
  unpack in the Eclipse plugin directory, just like Quantum. A new menu item will 
  appear both in the Bookmark View and the Table View. Using the menu item will 
  copy the data passed to the extender function to the clipboard. The source code 
  of that plugin should be used as an example to develop other extensions to Quantum.<br>
</p>
<p>If you want to extend Quantum from another plugin and have doubts, please contact 
  me with your questions.<br>

<h2>Creating a plugin that extends Quantum.</h2>
<p> We'll create a new plugin that extends Quantum. This tutorial assumes Eclipse 
  version 3 or higher. Also, you should already have loaded into your workspace 
  the Quantum project source code. So something like that should already be on 
  your <b>Package Explorer</b> view of Eclipse.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/quantum_plugin_workspace.jpg" width="281" height="750"></p>
<p>First we create a new plugin project using the new project wizard. Choose the 
  name you want, I used <b>com.quantum.extender</b></p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/new_plugin_wizard_page1.jpg" width="507" height="538"></p>
<p>Leave the second page as it is:</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/new_plugin_wizard_page2.jpg" width="507" height="538"></p>
<p>And directly hit <b>Finish.</b></p>
<p>Eclipse will create a new plugin with no functionality, and automatically open 
  the <b>plugin.xml</b> file in the editor (or MANIFEST.MF, depending on your 
  version). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/plugin_xml_overview.jpg" width="547" height="411"></p>
<p>You can customize here the name of the plugin, etc. Then move to the <b>Dependencies</b> 
  tab.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/plugin_xml_dependencies.jpg" width="621" height="417"></p>
<p>Your extender plugin must depend on the quantum plugin, both at run-time and 
  at compile-time. We add the run-time dependency in this tab of the <b>plugin.xml</b> 
  file. We click on the <b>Add...</b> button.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/plugin_xml_dependencies_selection.jpg" width="326" height="374"></p>
<p>And select the <b>com.quantum.Quantum</b> plugin from the list of possible 
  plugins. If the quantum plugin does not appear in the list, it's possibly that 
  you have not the quantum plugin in your workspace. Download the sources from 
  CVS.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the quantum plugin appears in our list of dependencies.</p>
<p>We navigate to the <b>Extension</b> tab. Here we define our extensions. If 
  you aren't used to Eclipse terminology, basically an <i>extension point</i> 
  is where you offer a point to be extended by other plugins (in this case is 
  Quantum the one that has the extension points), and a <i>extension</i> is the 
  code we write to take advantage of that extension point, and so, effectively, 
  <i>extend</i> it. In this case it's our <b>com.quantum.extender</b> plugin the 
  one that will extend the Quantum plugin extension points. For the moment, as 
  it's a new plugin, it has no extensions defined.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/plugin_xml_extensions.jpg" width="581" height="416"></p>
<p>The whole point of this plugin is to extend the quantum plug-in with new functionality, 
  so we next define the extensions. We use the <b>Add...</b> button to select 
  the extension points that we are going to use.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/plugin_xml_extensions_selection.jpg" width="358" height="502"></p>
<p>We select the <b>com.quantum.Quantum.metadata</b> extension point so as to 
  have access to the metadata (structure) of the tables and views of databases.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/plugin_xml_extensions_filled.jpg" width="576" height="415"></p>
<p>We give an id to our extension as <b>com.quantum.extender.metadata</b>, that 
  is, the id of our plugin, plus a more or less significative name. In the name 
  we put a short description of the exension point. The extension point we had 
  already selected in le left panel, and is automatically filled in the right 
  one.</p>
<p>So we have decided to extend this extension point of Quantum. Quantum has defined 
  a <b>schema</b> for that extension point. To see this schema, we open the <i>Quantum</i> 
  plugin.xml file (not the Extender plugin.xml that we have worked up to now).</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/quantum_plugin_xml_extension_points.jpg" width="591" height="417"></p>
<p>We notice the schema is saved in a subdirectory called <b>schema</b>, and is 
  called metadata.exsd. We click on the underlined <b>Schema:</b> label of the 
  right panel &quot;Extension Point Details&quot;, and the schema editor is opened 
  for us, displaying a short description of the schema.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/quantum_plugin_schema_editor.jpg" width="587" height="449"></p>
<p>Selecting the <b>extension</b> root of the tree, we see the structure that 
  this extension point needs if we want to &quot;connect&quot; to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>. In this schema, Quantum explains what it needs from anybody extending the 
  <b>metadata</b> extension point. Basically Quantum needs a string to use it 
  as a label in its menu.<b> <img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/quantum_plugin_schema_editor_extension.jpg" width="566" height="447"></b></p>
<p>Now we try to understand the schema. The left <b>Extension Point Element</b> 
  says that anybody extending this metadata extension point needs to give a &quot;point&quot;, 
  and &quot;id&quot; and a &quot;name&quot;. Those are the attributes of <b>extension</b> 
  in our schemna. That's more or less standard for all extension points. The little 
  orange ball near the icon of the <b>point</b> attribute says that it's required, 
  the other two not really. We have already provided in our extension that three 
  items. We have just filled them up, if you remember, in our plugin.xml file 
  for the com.quantum.extender plugin. </p>
<p>But that's of course not enough information for Quantum to make an extension. 
  At the very least we need a string to display in the Quantum menu, so that the 
  user can use the extension. So there is anoter element, <b>metadataActor</b>.</p>
<p>The right <b>Grammar</b> pannel says that the extension, aside from having 
  those properties, has a <i>sequence<b> </b></i> of <b>metadataActor</b> elements. 
  That is because we can define several menu items with several different functionalities. 
  And each metadataActor has two attributes, the <b>label</b>, and the <b>class</b>. 
  They are not defined as required, but nothing much is going to happen if you 
  don't define them, so you better give them. The little pencil on the icon tells 
  you that the attribute has an annotation that you can read and help you understand 
  what's that attribute for. If you click on <b>label</b>:</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/quantum_plugin_schema_editor_extension_label.jpg" width="563" height="448"></p>
<p>A short description appears in the box labeled <b>Description</b>. This tells 
  us that the <b>label</b> attribute is the string that we want to appear in the 
  Quantum menu. If we click on <b>class</b>, it tells us that the class attribute 
  is the name of the class that Quantum is going to call when the user selects 
  the menu item. Of course that class is to be provided by us, when writing the 
  extender plugin. </p>
<p>So we go back to our <b>plugin.xml</b> file editor, and create a new metadataActor 
  element in our extension. We select our just-defined extension and right-click 
  on it, and select on the menu that we want to create a new metadataActor.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/plugin_xml_extensions_new_actor.jpg" width="563" height="452"></p>
<p>A new <b>metadataActor</b> item appears on the left panel, and two empty boxes 
  on the right panel, with the names of the attributes that Quantum defined for 
  the metadataActor. We fill the <b>label</b> with the string that we want to 
  appear on the Quantum menu. It has to be something significative to the user 
  of the application. We decide to make our extension point generate a C++ class 
  with the info from the database metadata. So we give an adequate label, and 
  then an appropiate class name. The class does not exist yet. The editor offers 
  us no helper to select an already-defined class simply because it has no idea 
  that the value of the <b>class</b> attribute is to be a java class. Only the 
  Quantum plugin, that defined the <b>metadataActor</b> element will know that. 
  To the editor, they are all just attributes with strings in them, because that's 
  the way they are defined. I think that you can define an attribute to be a java 
  element, but you'll have to check that for yourself. After filling up the label 
  and the class, the editor looks like that. </p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/plugin_xml_extensions_new_actor_filled.jpg" width="609" height="449"></p>
<p>We save the changes to the <b>plugin.xml</b> file, and proceed to the next 
  step.</p>
<p>We have promised the extension point a class called <b>com.quantum.extender.GenerateCppClass</b>. 
  It would be nice from us to provide one such class, because up to the moment 
  it's just a figment of our imagination.</p>
<p>So go to the <b>com.quantum.extender</b> package in the <b>Package Explorer</b> 
  of Eclipse. This package will only have the <b>ExtenderPlugin</b> class, generated 
  by the New Project wizard. Now we add another class using the add new class 
  wizard.</p>
<p> <img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/new_class_generate.jpg" ></p>
<p>Notice that we have added the interface <b>com.quantum.extensions.IMetadataExtension</b>. 
  Quantum needs that interface to be sure that the function it's going to call 
  exists. In this case the interface defines a single function <b>run(Document 
  doc)</b>. This <b>Document</b> is a <b>org.w3c.dom.Document</b> object that 
  Quantum will pass to the <b>run()</b> function when calling it. That document 
  will have XML with the metadata of the selected element in the GUI of Quantum.</p>
<p>The new class wizard generates an stub for function <b>run()</b> that does 
  nothing, but that's enough for us. We can now test that the extension point 
  works. We set a breakpoint in the <b>run()</b> function and execute Quantum 
  in debug mode to see if our new menu item really appears in Quantum. </p>
<p>Now, when we execute Quantum in a debug environment as an Eclipse Application, 
  and open a bookmark, and right-click on a table to get the context menu, we 
  get a new menu item, that did not appear previously.</p>
<p><b>Before defining the extension: </b><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/context_menu_metadata_before.jpg" width="173" height="78"> 
  <b>After:</b> <img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/context_menu_metadata_after.jpg" width="173" height="88"></p>
<p>The <b>Extensions</b> menu item is a generic Quantum item to group all extensions, 
  in this case extensions of type <b>metadata</b>. If you open the <b>Extensions</b> 
  menu item, your defined extension menu item will appear.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/context_menu_expanded.jpg" width="396" height="106"></p>
<p>The used string is not exactly what you wrote, but adds at the beginning the 
  name of the extender plugin, to have a bit of organization if several plugins 
  extend that point. At some time in the future, even a second level of sub-menus 
  based on the plugin name could be implemented.</p>
<p>Well, then you select your just-generated menu item, and the <b>run()</b> function 
  gets called. You know that because you put a breakpoint there, and it has just 
  been hit. In your <b>run()</b> function, you receive a single parameter with 
  the XML description of the selected items. You can make a first test of that 
  by simply copying the received XML to the clipboard. To that end we write</p>
<blockquote><pre> 
 		public void run(Document doc) {
		QuantumPlugin.getDefault().getSysClip().setContents(
			new Object[] { com.quantum.ExternalInterface.xmlToString(doc) },
			new Transfer[] { TextTransfer.getInstance()});
		}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The <b>xmlToString()</b> is a function that gets an <b>org.w3c.dom.Node</b> 
  and converts it to a String. It's part from the <b>com.quantum.ExternalInterface</b> 
  class. This class is where Quantum groups some functions (from 2.4.5 version 
  onwards) for use of extender plug-ins. More on that later. Anyway, we test and 
  get this xml code into the clipboard.</p>

<pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;<br>&lt;Metadata&gt;<br>	&lt;Author&gt;Quantum&lt;/Author&gt;<br>	&lt;Version&gt;0.4&lt;/Version&gt;<br>	&lt;table database=&quot;Oracle&quot; isSynonym=&quot;false&quot; name=&quot;BONUS&quot; schema=&quot;SCOTT&quot;&gt;<br>		&lt;column java.sql.Types=&quot;12&quot; name=&quot;ENAME&quot; nullable=&quot;true&quot; position=&quot;1&quot; primaryKey=&quot;false&quot; size=&quot;10&quot; type=&quot;VARCHAR2&quot; /&gt;<br>		&lt;column java.sql.Types=&quot;12&quot; name=&quot;JOB&quot; nullable=&quot;true&quot; position=&quot;2&quot; primaryKey=&quot;false&quot; size=&quot;9&quot; type=&quot;VARCHAR2&quot; /&gt;<br>		&lt;column java.sql.Types=&quot;3&quot; name=&quot;SAL&quot; nullable=&quot;true&quot; position=&quot;3&quot; primaryKey=&quot;false&quot; size=&quot;22&quot; type=&quot;NUMBER&quot; /&gt;<br>		&lt;column java.sql.Types=&quot;3&quot; name=&quot;COMM&quot; nullable=&quot;true&quot; position=&quot;4&quot; primaryKey=&quot;false&quot; size=&quot;22&quot; type=&quot;NUMBER&quot; /&gt;<br>	&lt;/table&gt;<br>&lt;/Metadata&gt;</pre>

<p>Now we want to do something about it. We can of course use the supplied 
  XML node directly to interrogate it about the different tags. The structure 
  of the XML and the name of the tags and attributes are likely to remain constant 
  over time, although new items will surely be added. As a better alternative 
  is to use the Quantum <b>ExternalInterface</b> class to extract metadata information 
  from this XML.</p>
<h2>The com.quantum.ExternalInterface class</h2>
<p>The com.quantum.ExternalInterface class is a class designed to be used by external 
  plugin developers. The methods in this class are to be rather stable, and also 
  easy to understand and use. The functions in this class try to use as far as 
  possible regular java classes instead of more mutable Quantum classes. For example, 
  the function <code>getBookmarkNames()</code>returns as string array with the 
  names of the bookmarks defined in Quantum. The functions are commented and usually 
  it's purpose is rather straightforward. The best way of knowing that class is 
  by reading the source. When developing a Quantum extension, is better to go 
  there first to see if your required functionality already exists, before delving 
  deeper into Quantum code to get it. And if your funcionality is not there and 
  it's general-purpose, please ask for a new function to be added to the interface 
  to the Quantum developers (or better still, supply your own patch :)</p>
<p>However, not always is practical to use only java classes. There are some functions 
  of <b>ExternalInterface</b> that return internal Quantum types. We'll see one 
  of them later.</p>
<p>Now we want to iterate the XML and see how many tables and views has, because 
  our code is only interested in tables and views. We could use the <b>NodeIterator</b> 
  and <b>NodeFilter</b> from the org.w3c.dom specification, but Quantum defines 
  an iterator of its own. It's still only partially developed, the use now would 
  be:</p>
<pre>	public void run(Document doc) {<br>		Iterator iter = new XMLMetadataIterator(doc, 0);<br>		int i = 1;<br>		while (iter.hasNext()) {<br>			Node node = (Node) iter.next();<br>			MessageDialog.openInformation(<br>				      ExtenderPlugin.getDefault().getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getShell(),<br>				      &quot;Element &quot; + String.valueOf(i),com.quantum.ExternalInterface.xmlToString(node));<br>			i++;<br>		}<br>	}
</pre>
<p>The code I guess is clear enough. The <b>XMLMetadataIterator</b> receives a 
  <b>Document</b> to iterate over, and an ugly flag, that up to now can be only 
  0 or -1. -1 if all nodes are to be iterated, 0 if only tables and views. In 
  the future, more options will probably be added. We select only tables and views, 
  and make a simple iteration to display the resulting nodes. Note that <b>XMLMetadataIterator</b> 
  is not part of the &quot;stable&quot; external interface of Quantum and so subject 
  to more change. You can navigate the document using the normal DOM specifications.</p>
<p>Following with our program, we want to do something more interesting than just 
  displaying the items, so we extract the metadata from them. To do this, Quantum 
  has a class called <b>XMLToModelConverter</b>. This class allows you to get 
  metadata in a simple way from the XML. The use would be something like:</p>
<pre> 	public void run(Document doc) {<br>		Iterator iter = new XMLMetadataIterator(doc, 0);<br>		int i = 1;<br>		while (iter.hasNext()) {<br>			Node node = (Node) iter.next();<br>			TableMetadata metadata = new XMLToModelConverter((Element)node);<br>			MessageDialog.openInformation(<br>				      ExtenderPlugin.getDefault().getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getShell(),<br>				      &quot;Element &quot; + String.valueOf(i),<br>				      &quot;Name : &quot; + metadata.getName() + &quot;\n&quot; );<br>			i++;<br>		}<br>	}
</pre>
<p>From the <b>TableMetadata</b> object that we have got, we can get the columns 
  and the metadata from them, using again, of course, another Quantum interface, 
  the <b>Column</b>, that holds the metadata of a single column. The code to get 
  the columns and its metadata could be like:
<pre>			Column[] columns = null;<br>			try {<br>				columns = metadata.getColumns();<br>			} catch (NotConnectedException e) {<br>			} catch (SQLException e) {<br>			}<br>			if (columns != null) {<br>				for (int j = 0; j &lt; columns.length; j++) {<br>					Column column = columns[j];<br>					String name = column.getName();<br>					int type = column.getType();
				}
   			}
</pre>
<p> Now you have all the elements needed to make a Quantum extension plugin, or 
  at least I hope you do. </p>
<h2>The <i>data</i> extension point</h2>
<p>Extending the other extension point should be straightforward from here. Just 
  remember that your class should now extend the IDataExtension interface, to 
  allow quantum to differentiate it.The only other difference is the location 
  of the menu and the XML format. In this case, the <b>data</b> extension point, 
  the menu extended is the context menu of the Table View. Normally it appears 
  as :</p>
<p><img src="../images/quantum_table_view_context_menu.jpg" width="135" height="188"></p>
<p>If an extension is defined it appears as:</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_extender_plugin/quantum_table_view_context_menu_extended.jpg" width="424" height="243"></p>
<p>The selected rows are copied to the clipboard using the following XML. The 
  &lt;table&gt; tag is similar to what we have seen before, and only the two data 
  rows are added, using the &lt;DataRow&gt; tag, that contains the actual data 
  in tags named with the respective column names.</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;<br>&lt;Metadata&gt;<br>	&lt;Author&gt;Quantum&lt;/Author&gt;<br>	&lt;Version&gt;1.1&lt;/Version&gt;<br>	&lt;table bookmark=&quot;ScottDB&quot; database=&quot;Oracle&quot; isSynonym=&quot;false&quot; name=&quot;DEPT&quot; schema=&quot;SCOTT&quot;&gt;<br>		&lt;column java.sql.Types=&quot;3&quot; name=&quot;DEPTNO&quot; nullable=&quot;false&quot; position=&quot;1&quot; primaryKey=&quot;true&quot; size=&quot;2&quot; type=&quot;NUMBER&quot; /&gt;<br>		&lt;column java.sql.Types=&quot;12&quot; name=&quot;DNAME&quot; nullable=&quot;true&quot; position=&quot;2&quot; primaryKey=&quot;false&quot; size=&quot;14&quot; type=&quot;VARCHAR2&quot; /&gt;<br>		&lt;column java.sql.Types=&quot;12&quot; name=&quot;LOC&quot; nullable=&quot;true&quot; position=&quot;3&quot; primaryKey=&quot;false&quot; size=&quot;13&quot; type=&quot;VARCHAR2&quot; /&gt;<br>	&lt;/table&gt;<br>	&lt;DataRow&gt;<br>		&lt;DEPTNO&gt;20&lt;/DEPTNO&gt;<br>		&lt;DNAME&gt;RESEARCH&lt;/DNAME&gt;<br>		&lt;LOC&gt;DALLAS&lt;/LOC&gt;<br>	&lt;/DataRow&gt;<br>	&lt;DataRow&gt;<br>		&lt;DEPTNO&gt;40&lt;/DEPTNO&gt;<br>		&lt;DNAME&gt;OPERATIONS&lt;/DNAME&gt;<br>		&lt;LOC&gt;BOSTON&lt;/LOC&gt;<br>	&lt;/DataRow&gt;<br>&lt;/Metadata&gt;

</pre>
<p>There are no functions to help the user extract this data from the XML, but 
  could be created if popular demand grants it;o)<br>
