<h1>Changes Since 3.0.1</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The SQL Editor has been updated to enhance syntax highlighting, content 
    assist, syntax checking and quick fixes.</li>
  <li>The editor outline page has changed.</li>
  <li>There is a new graphical Entity-Relationship editor, in experimental form. 
    See the help page &quot;The Entity Relationship Editor&quot; for more info 
    and use instructions.</li>
  <li>There is a new option in &quot;Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Quantum DB&quot; 
    called <b>Maximum chars in cell in Table View </b>. It allows you to change 
    the 2048 default for the maximum cell buffer size in case you have cells holding 
    more text that that.</li>
  <li>Three new options in the preferences page of the Bookmark. : 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Strip new lines when sending to JDBC</b> is an option thought for 
        some JDBC drivers for DB2, that seem to get confused by newlines. Don't 
        check it if you have not that particular problem. The newlines are substituted 
        by spaces. Default unchecked.</li>
      <li><b>Send query text as-is to the JDBC</b> does exactly that. Normally 
        Quantum will parse the queries text and divide it into queries and send 
        those queries one by one to the JDBC driver. However, sometimes is better 
        to forget about that and just send what you wrote exactly as it is to 
        the JDBC driver (if <b>Strip new lines when sending to JDBC</b> is checked, 
        it's still applied). Default unchecked.</li>
      <li><b>Default encoding</b> defines a default encoding for all tables in 
        that bookmark. Useful for not having to change the encoding every time. 
        Leave blank (default) if the normal encoding applied by the java machine 
        suits you fine.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The DB2 adapter for AS400 has been updated by a nice user with an AS400 
    (gudavallign in feature request 1510247). Now if you use that database, more 
    data will appear in the </li>
  <li>
    <p> The Search utility is somewhat changed, I append the relevant portion 
      of the help.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Search</b> offers a search utility, to search for text, numbers or 
        dates in the selected tables or views, or even procedures if methods for 
        accessing procedures are available in the database. The search is integrated 
        with the standard search dialog of Eclipse, so it'll appear alongide other 
        search possibilities. The dialog will appear blank if you invoke search 
        from the Eclipse menu, but haven't selected anything searchable in the 
        bookmark view.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/quantum_search_dialog.jpg" width="494" height="372"></p>
    <p>You can for example introduce a string like &quot;JAPAN&quot; in the <b>String</b> 
      box, and Quantum will search all selected database objects (tables, views...) 
      for a exact match of the string. That is, a column that has the exact value 
      &quot;JAPAN&quot;. If you uncheck the <b>Match case</b> option, the search 
      will ignore the case of the string. However, that's not guaranteed to work, 
      as it depends on the capabilities of the database.</p>
    <p>If you want to search for all columns that contain the &quot;JAPAN&quot; 
      string, just use the <b>LIKE regexp (%_)</b> text box, and write &quot;%JAPAN%&quot;. 
      In this box you can insert regular expressions with LIKE syntax, that is, 
      using the wildcard characters <b>%</b> and <b>_</b> , where % will substitute 
      for any string, and _ will substitute for a single character. Please note 
      that, even if your database supports LIKE searchs into numeric columns (Oracle, 
      for example), Quantum will not attempt it, and search only textual columns, 
      as long as they are defined searchable by the database.</p>
    <p>If you want to search for a number, insert it into the <b>Number</b> text 
      box and it'll attempt to find an exact match in numeric columns. Same goes 
      for dates, where you can specify just one (<b>Start date</b>), or a range 
      with a <b>Start date</b> and an <b>End date</b>.</p>
    <p>The search results will appear in the <b>Quantum Search Results</b> view, 
      where you can see the tables found, the column(s) where the result was found, 
      and the needed key (in case it exists) needed to retrieve the matching rows. 
      Double-click on the tables names will open the table in the Table View. 
      If you want just the column where the search succeeded, double-click on 
      the column. If you want just the row where the search succeeded, double-click 
      on the &quot;key&quot; entry. </p>
    <p><img src="images/quantum_search_results_view.jpg" width="392" height="213"></p>
    <p>And that's all there is to the search. Many variables will affect the result 
      of your search, including database capabilities and undiscovered bugs, so 
      don't take the results as complete or definitive.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for developers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The grammar depends on antlr. Developers should install the antlr plugin 
    and toggle antlr nature using the context menu of the top level package</li>
  <li>For forthcoming changes, Quantum already depends on GEF</li>
  <li>All editor related data structures are part of SQLSyntaxModelImpl</li>
</ul>
