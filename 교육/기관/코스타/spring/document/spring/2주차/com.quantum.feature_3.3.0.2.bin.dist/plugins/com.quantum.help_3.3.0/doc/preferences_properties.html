<h1>Quantum Preferences and Properties</h1>
<p>As in other plugins in Eclipse, we must differentiate between Preferences and 
  Properties. Preferences apply to all of the items in the plugin, and properties 
  only to one.</p>
<p>The Quantum generic preferences are accessed in the same place as other Eclipse 
  plug-ins, under <code>Window &gt; Preferences </code>, and then <code>Quantum 
  DB</code>. </p>
<p>The properties that apply to a particular item will be accessed selecting the 
  item and clicking on &quot;Properties&quot; in the context menu.</p>
<h2><a name="preferences"></a>Preferences</h2>
<h2><img src="images/quantum_preferences_tree.jpg" width="134" height="117"></h2>
<h3><a name="rootPreferences"></a>Root preferences (Quantum DB)</h3>
<p>The Quantum preferences tree is to date like this. The main Preferences screen, 
  that you get when you select the top of the tree (Quantum DB, like in the image), 
  is:</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_preferences_root.jpg"  ></p>
<p>The <b>Maximum size of query history</b> is self-explanatory. </p>
<p>The <b>Default-files directory path</b> is not (self-explanatory, I mean). 
</p>
<p>Quantum DB allows (from version 2.4.5) the possibility of having a default 
  bookmark file, for new installations. This bookmak file will be called <code>def_bookmarks_&lt;operating-system&gt;.xml</code>, 
  and is to be found in the path set in <b>Default-files directory path</b> preference. 
  The &quot;&lt;operating-system&gt;&quot; part of the file name is the Eclipse 
  abbreviation for operating systems. So if you are in a Windows system, the file 
  name will be <code>def_bookmarks_win32.xml</code>, if you are in linux, <code>def_bookmarks_linux.xml</code>, 
  etc. This makes easier to bundle Quantum with other plugins, and offer a ready-made 
  default connection. If no path is given, Quantum will look in the Eclipse installation 
  directory for the file.</p>
<p>The <b>Maximum rows in Table View (0 = no limit)</b> allows the user to set 
  a limit (default 200) to the rows that the Table View will show when displaying 
  a Table, View, or Query. If you set it to 0, all the rows will be displayed, 
  what can easily leave you out-of-memory, so use with care.</p>
<p>The <b>Maximum chars in cell in Table View </b>allows you to change the 2048 
  default for the maximum cell buffer size in case you have cells holding more 
  text that that.</p>
<p>The <b>Loggin Preferences</b> refer to the <b><a href="sql_log_view.html">Quantum 
  SQL Log</a></b><a href="sql_log_view.html"> view</a>. You can set the maximum 
  number of saved entries, and the level of detail of the logging. </p>
<h3><a name="copyPreferences"></a>Copy preferences</h3>
<p>Copy preferences asks only for the <b>Normal Copy Separator</b>, that only 
  is applied when copying several columns. If you select several columns from 
  the bookmarks view, and hit <b>Copy</b>, the column names will be copied to 
  the clipboard, separated by the separator you have selected. For more complex 
  copy customization, there are the three next preference pages, the <a href="quantum_custom_copy.html">Custom 
  Copy</a>. As custom copy is rather complex, it's described in a separate page. 
  Click the preceding link to learn about it.</p>
<h3><a name="databasesPreferences"></a>Databases preferences</h3>
<p>Database preferences set some general preferences for databases. These could 
  possibly one day be made into bookmark properties. To date, they only work for 
  Oracle, and they are selectable because the <b>Get Remarks for Columns</b> option 
  makes for a extremely slow column query (when you expand a table to see the 
  columns it has).</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_preferences_databases.jpg" width="630" height="539"></p>
<p><b>Get Remarks for Columns</b> allows the user (for now only for Oracle) to 
  see the possible remarks defined for the columns. These will be shown in the 
  XML generated when you copy a table, or in the Properties of the table.</p>
<p><b>Get Synonyms from Database</b> makes the bookmark display not only the tables 
  and views, but also the synonyms, marked with a different icon. This option 
  is also to date only available for Oracle databases.</p>
<h3><a name="sqlEditorPreferences"></a>SQL Editor Preferences</h3>
<p>This preferences page is pretty much self-explanatory. It allows you to choose 
  the font for your SQL Editor view, the colors of the background and the different 
  syntax highlighting elements.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_preferences_sql_editor.jpg" width="630" height="539"></p>
<h2><a name="exportPreferences"></a>Export Preferences</h2>
<h2><img src="images/quantum_preferences_export.jpg" width="580" height="360"></h2>
<p>Depending on your configuration of quantum features, you'll have export capabilitites. 
  The configuration options for the Export capabilities are defined in the <b>Export</b> 
  item. The only general option for now, is the possibility of making Quantum 
  not ask you for confirmation when overwriting exported files.</p>
<p>There are preferences too for the CSV (Comma Separated Values) export.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_preferences_export_csv.jpg" width="489" height="367"></p>
<p>You can set the default for writing column headers, with the <b>Write Column 
  Headers ?</b> check box.</p>
<p>The <b>Default Column Separator</b> text box gives you the possibility of changing 
  the default for the separator between data columns. Usually is a comma, as the 
  name implies, but, at least for some applications (read Excel), that changes 
  depending on the localization settings of the operating system.</p>
<p>You can also set a default path for you saved files, and a default file name, 
  so you don't need to give one when making fast export tests.</p>
<h2><a name="properties"></a>Properties</h2>
<h3><a name="bookmarkProperties"></a>Bookmark Properties</h3>
<p>Selecting a Bookmark in the Bookmark view, and then using the context menu 
  to get the Properties, gets you the following dialog:</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_boomark_properties.jpg" width="630" height="539"></p>
<p>In the first selection of the lef tree (<b>Bookmark</b>) you get to change 
  some options of the Bookmark. The first tab, shown in the image, allows to change 
  the Connection data. You can also change the JDBC driver using the second tab. 
  Those options are the same as when creating a bookmark. Refer to &quot;<a href="getting_started_connections.html">Creating 
  a bookmark</a>&quot; for more info.</p>
<h4><a name="autoCommit"></a>Auto-Commit </h4>
<p>The third tab, <b>Options</b>, allows you to change two options of the Bookmark 
  (at the moment). The first one is the Auto-Commit feature. It has three possibilities: 
  <i>Always True, Always False </i>and <i>Last Saved</i>. If you select <i>Always 
  True</i>, all your SQL statements issued against that bookmark will be automatically 
  committed on completion. So if you make an INSERT statement, the inserted data 
  will be part from the shared database table from the moment the INSERT is finished. 
  If you select <i> Always False</i>, you won't have any automatic commit, and 
  you'll have to manually commit all your SQL statements that modify data in the 
  database. This selection is de <i>default</i> selection for that bookmark, and 
  will be used when the bookmark is open. Then you can change the auto-commit 
  value using the <a href="query_editor_view.html#toolbarMenu">toolbar menu in 
  the SQL Query Editor view</a>. </p>
<p>If you select the third option <i>Last Saved</i>, then your selection in the 
  toolbar menu of the SQL Query Editor view will be remembered and used the next 
  time you open that bookmark.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_bookmark_properties_options.jpg" ></p>
<p>The second one, <b>Ignore the Autocommit setting of the Query View</b>, does 
  just that. If set, the connection for that bookmark will have the AutoCommit 
  defined in the first option, no matter what the Query View says. Note that this 
  behaviour will be silent, so you have to be sure of what you are doing when 
  setting this option, specially if you have the &quot;on-connection AutoCommit&quot; 
  option to <b>Always True</b>.</p>
<p>The third one,<b>Qoute all schemas, tables and columns</b>, permits you to 
  quote all schemas, tables and columns in the quantum generated SQL. The default 
  is unchecked, that is, quote only the names that have spaces, signs, mixed case 
  or are a reserved keyword (this last only from version 2.4.5). Quoting everything 
  is safer, but uglier on display.</p>
<p><b>Strip new lines when sending to JDBC</b> is an option thought for some JDBC 
  drivers for DB2, that seem to get confused by newlines. Don't check it if you 
  have not that particular problem. The newlines are substituted by spaces. Default 
  unchecked. </p>
<p><b>Send query text as-is to the JDBC</b> does exactly that. Normally Quantum 
  will parse the queries text and divide it into queries and send those queries 
  one by one to the JDBC driver. However, sometimes is better to forget about 
  that and just send what you wrote exactly as it is to the JDBC driver (if <b>Strip 
  new lines when sending to JDBC</b> is checked, it's still applied). Default 
  unchecked.</p>
<p><b>Default encoding</b> defines a default encoding for all tables in that bookmark. 
  Useful for not having to change the encoding every time. Leave blank (default) 
  if the normal encoding applied by the java machine suits you fine.</p>
<h4>Schemas</h4>
<p>The tree item <b>Schemas</b> allows you to change the visible schemas in your 
  bookmark. It's the same as the Schema selection page in the Create New Bookmark 
  wizard.</p>
<h4>Database and Data Types</h4>
<p>The <b>Database</b> tree item simply shows you information about the database 
  to which the bookmark connects. The <b>Data Types</b> is similar, but shows 
  info about the data types supported by that database. Both are merely informational, 
  you cannot change anything there. These two categories are common to all items, 
  so if you only see them it's because the item has no properties of its own (like 
  the Quick List, for example).</p>
<h3><a name="tableProperties"></a>Table and View Properties </h3>
<p>Tables, views and sequences properties have the same elements, even if some 
  not apply, like Indices and References for View, for example.</p>
<p>The first category is <b>Columns</b>, where you can see the info for the columns 
  of the selected Table or View. No change is possible there. <b>Indices</b> and 
  <b>References</b> are also displays of the indices and references of the table.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_table_properties_columns.jpg" width="635" height="388"></p>
<p><b>SQL</b> shows the SELECT clause used to create the view . Note that it may 
  not be exact, as clauses like WITH CHECK OPTION can be not included (check the 
  SQL92 standard) and, in any case, it'll depend on the database, as IBM databases 
  tend to include the CREATE clause, for example. Some databases are not implemented 
  yet, so if you see a blank SQL, contact the Quantum developers with info about 
  the right query for your database. </p>
