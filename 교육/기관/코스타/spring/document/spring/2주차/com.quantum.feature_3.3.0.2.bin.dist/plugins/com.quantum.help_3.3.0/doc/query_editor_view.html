<h1>The SQL Query Editor View</h1>
<p>The <b>SQL Query Editor</b> is a view, not an editor in the Eclipse sense, 
  so it won't appear mixed with the other editors in the editors zone of the workspace. 
  However, you can use most of its functions in an editor, if you just edit a 
  <b>.sql</b> or a <b>.ddl</b> file. More on that <a href="#asEditor">at the end 
  of this page</a>. Its function is allow the user to introduce and to edit SQL 
  sentences and to execute them against the databases defined in Quantum. It looks 
  like this when you have written something on it:</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_sql_query_full.jpg" width="429" height="220"></p>
<p>As you can see, the editor highlights some SQL syntax features. The colors 
  of the highlighted text are selectable in the <a href="preferences_properties.html">Quantum 
  preferences</a>.</p>
<p>When you want to execute your SQL query, you select the bookmark against which 
  to execute using the <img src="images/quantum_sql_query_execute_button.jpg" width="52" height="45"> 
  little black button near the green button (the execute button). When you click 
  on it, a list of bookmarks appear for you to select. The currently selected 
  appears above, separated from the rest by a line.</p>
<p>. <img src="images/quantum_sql_query_execute_button_open.jpg" width="173" height="443"></p>
<p>If you simply hit the green execute button, the last selected bookmark will 
  be used to execute against. That selected bookmark will also be shown as a window 
  tip if you hover the mouse pointer over the execute button. This selected bookmark 
  will change also if you double-click on a <b><a href="working_bookmarks.html#recentQueries">Recent 
  Query</a> </b> on any bookmark (it will change to be the parent bookmark of 
  the selected query). If the selected bookmark is not opened, Quantum will try 
  to open it and execute the statement afterwards.</p>
<p>If your SQL statement return some results, the results will be displayed in 
  the <b><a href="table_view.html">Quantum Table View</a></b>.</p>
<p>You can write several queries, separated by semicolons. Quantum will send then 
  one after another to the database JDBC driver to be executed. If you want to 
  execute only one query or a part of them, you have the option to select the 
  text and hitting the execute button. If there is something selected in the Query 
  view, when the execute button is hit, only the selected text will be executed. 
  You can also double-click on a character in the view, and that will automatically 
  select its corresponding statement, limited by semicolons. Then you can execute 
  it. </p>
<p>When you execute a query, the resulting status of the query and the time used, 
  is displayed on the status bar of Eclipse. If the database reports any error, 
  the message reported is displayed in a message box.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_sql_query_status_bar.jpg" width="478" height="39"></p>
<p>Next to the execute button, there is an &quot;erase&quot; button with an eraser 
  icon on it <img src="images/quantum_sql_query_erase_button.jpg" width="27" height="31">. 
  Pressing this button will clear the SQL Query view from all text.</p>
<h2><a name="toolbarMenu"></a>The toolbar menu</h2>
<p>At the right side of the toolbar, there is an expandable menu with some options.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_sql_toolbar_menu.jpg" width="240" height="218" ></p>
<p>You can Import a Query from an external file, and save (Export) one that you 
  have written to a file. You can change your <b>AutoCommit</b> selection on the 
  active bookmark, and execute a <b>Rollback</b> or a <b>Commit</b>, as convenience 
  functions. Or course the rollback will do nothing if you have <b>AutoCommit</b> 
  selected (the default). For more options on <b>AutoCommit</b>, see the <a href="preferences_properties.html">Preferences 
  Help</a>. </p>
<p>The <b>Copy As Java</b> option will copy the existing text in the Query View 
  and format it ready to be inserted as java code for the creation of a String. 
  For example:</p>
<p><code>SELECT * <br>
  FROM &quot;TEMP&quot;<br>
  WHERE ID = 45</code></p>
<p>will be copied to the clipboard as :</p>
<p><code>&quot;SELECT * &quot; +<br>
  &quot;FROM \&quot;TEMP\&quot; &quot; +<br>
  &quot;WHERE ID = 45 &quot; ;</code></p>
<p><code>The next option <b>Paste From Java</b> tries to do the inverse of that 
  procedure. So if you have in the clipboard something like</code></p>
<p><code>&quot;SELECT * &quot; +<br>
  &quot;FROM \&quot;TEMP\&quot; &quot; +<br>
  &quot;WHERE ID = 45 &quot; ;</code></p>
<p>it'll paste into the Query View the string resulting from evaluating the java 
  code (using the JavaBean interpreter). So it'll return </p>
<p><code>SELECT * <br>
  FROM &quot;TEMP&quot;<br>
  WHERE ID = 45</code></p>
<p><code>The option <b>Paste tableview query</b> will look at which tab is active 
  (displayed) in the Table View and will paste into the Query View the SELECT 
  used to generate that tab data.</code></p>
<p><code>The <b>Use single tab for query editor results</b> option allows you 
  to select if you want to reuse your tabs in the Table View (for repeated queries) 
  or rather generate a new one for each. Default is true.</code></p>
<p></p>
<h2><a name="asEditor"></a>Using the Query View as an Editor</h2>
<p>If you edit an <b>.SQL</b> or <b>.DDL</b> file after installing Quantum, those 
  extensions should launch an Editor based on the Query View. If you don't get 
  it, that's possibly because some other plugin has broken the link. You can remake 
  the link (or apply to other extensions) in <b>Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;General-&gt;FileAssociations</b>.</p>
<p>Once you have open the file with the editor, the usual editor lifecycle applies, 
  that is, your data is associated to a file, editors remain in place between 
  Eclipse invocations, etc. Also, you'll be able to use many standard editor commands 
  that you cannot use in the Query View, like <b>Undo</b>, or <b>Search/Replace</b>. 
  You can execute your file by the context menu, selecting <b>Execute</b>, and 
  then the bookmark.</p>
<p><img src="images/quantum_query_editor_context_menu.jpg" width="180" height="174"></p>
<p>The Editor does not allow you to change the <b>AutoCommit</b> property of the 
  connection, so you have to remember which is it.</p>
