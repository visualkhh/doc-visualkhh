<h1>Changes Since 3.0.0</h1>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <h3> Now Quantum requires the GEF plugin to work. So if you don't have it 
      installed, get it (easiest way if you are in 3.1 from &quot;Help-&gt;Software 
      Updates-&gt;Find &amp; Install&quot;, else download the required version 
      from the Eclipse website).</h3>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Now double-clicking on a character in the Query View<b><font color="#000000"> 
    </font></b><font color="#000000">will select the corresponding SQL command 
    (defined by semicolons). You can then execute that command only.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">The sort-filter string in the Table View is now editable</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">There is a new option (<b>Paste tableview query</b>) 
    in the menu of the Query view that adds into the Query view the SQL SELECT 
    command that was used to create the displayed table view.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">There is a new option (<b>Paste from Java</b>) in 
    the menu of the Query view that adds into the Query view the SQL code resulting 
    from stripping the commas and other marks from the java code that was in the 
    clipboard. To use it, copy some java code (that resolves into a string) into 
    the clipboard, and then the Paste from java will evaluate the string (using 
    JavaBean) and return the result into the Query View.</font></li>
  <li>The new behaviour of the Table view (not generating new tabs for the same 
    table or query) is now selectable in the Query View menu (default is new system). 
  </li>
  <li>A search utility is now available. You can search for a string in a range 
    of tables and/or views, or a whole bookmark. Just select the tables/views 
    in which to search, select the context menu and then &quot;Search&quot;. Then 
    the &quot;Quantum Search Results&quot; view should appear, with the results, 
    if any. The results are the tables or views that contain in any column the 
    searched string or number.</li>
  <li>Basic Drag-and-Drop functionality has been added between the Bookmark View 
    and the Query View. Now you can drag a table to the Query view to get the 
    name of the table.</li>
</ul>
