<h1>Ms Access database support</h1>
<p>Ms Access is a database with no public free JDBC driver, so if you want to 
  get to your data from Quantum you'll use the JDBC-ODBC driver. If you have a 
  propietary JDBC driver you'll probably be better off using it as a generic driver. 
  From version 3.1 of Quantum there is added support for Access. The following 
  points will outline how to get it and what to expect. The support has been tested 
  with Access 2000 and may fail with any other version, as it depends on the data 
  structure of the Access system tables. Feedback on that will be welcome.</p>
<h2>How to use the Access support.</h2>
<p>First thing you need to create a new bookmark using the Access inside driver 
  of Quantum. This driver is simply the old JDBC-ODBC driver but identifying the 
  database to use as Access so Quantum will know how to treat it. In the image 
  you see the Access driver highlighted.</p>

<p>When you select it, the following message will appear:</p>
<p><img src="images/access_warning_message.jpg" width="441" height="139"></p>
<p>This is because the access support in Quantum will make use of the system tables 
  to extract information unavailabe via the ODBC driver. Those tables, although 
  you can read them from inside Access with no problem (once they are visible), 
  are not accessible to the ODBC driver, and so to the JDBC-ODBC bridge. So you 
  need to allow the Administrator user (that's the default user) to read those 
  tables. For that, you open your Access database from Access and go to <b>Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;View</b> 
  and mark the &quot;<b>System Objects</b>&quot; check box. You'll now be able 
  to see the system tables in your Tables tab. Then go to <b>Tools-&gt;Security-&gt;User 
  and Group Permissions</b> and grant read access to the administrator user for 
  all the tables starting with &quot;MSys&quot;. After you have done it, the Quantum 
  adapter will be able to access those tables and extract some measure of metadata 
  from your database.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the setting up of the bookmar is identical to a normal JDBC-ODBC 
  setup. You simply put your ODBC source in the URL and will access it.</p>
<p>If you already have MsAccess bookmarks using the normal JDBC-ODBC driver, you 
  can simply change the JDBC driver (and give read permissions to the system tables, 
  of course) to enjoy the new features.</p>
<h2>Supported Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>More tables and views (queries) will appear now in the bookmark view. Action 
    queries in particular will appear. Also will appear some temporary queries 
    that may bother you, but I decided to keep them in case you use Quantum to 
    try to extract data from a broken Access database and want to see also those 
    temporary queries. You can always compress your Access database, which will 
    make those queries dissapear.</li>
  <li>The queries will show its SQL in the <code>Properties</code> dialog. That 
    SQL is extracted from the system tables and can be wrong, so don't trust it 
    too much for the moment. If you see some malformed SQL (doesn't match the 
    SQL that you see when you design your Query in Access), please contact the 
    developers team giving your query SQL.</li>
  <li>Relationships between tables are now recognized by Quantum.</li>
</ul>
